My Hydroponics Project.
  In this project I looked to create an autonomous gardening system,
  including hands-free watering, pH control, and full control over
  the conditions.
  Code is currently based around Arduino, and is going to be updated to
  C++ for my switch to an ESP32 Huzzah Featherboard.
